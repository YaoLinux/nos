READ CAREFULLLY:

In order to make this NVIDIA Package working, it's necessary to compile the corresponding modules kernel: 

To manage this, here is one of the method:

1/ Install all the devel packages

    $ get cards.devel

2/ Install the headers (devel package ) of your kernel

   $ get kernel.devel

OR
   $ get kernel-lts.devel

3/ Extract somewhere the Archive of your NVIDIA packager and enter into it

  $ sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-384.59.run --extract-only

4/ compile and install the modules for your NVIDIA Cards

 $ cd NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-384.59/kernel
 $ make modules
 $ sudo make modules_install

Your kernel modules for your NVIDIA graphical cards are in:

/lib/modules/XXXX/kernel/drivers/video/

5/ Reboot and cross fingers
